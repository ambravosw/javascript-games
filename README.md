# Javascript Games

I have developed the games shown in the video: 

**Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games - Full Course** [ https://youtu.be/lhNdUVh3qCc ]

1. memory card = 3:11
2. whac-a-mole = 11:39
3. connect four = 19:49
4. snake = 27:37
5. space invaders = 43:10
6. frogger = 59:06

Based on this video I have developed the games in OOP paradigm.
